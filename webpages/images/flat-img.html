<h2><strong>Why luxury housing is achieving high demand in India?</strong></h2>

<div class="body_img"><img alt="" src="https://www.hcorealestates.com/img/blogs/1ca0f66728_Whyluxuryhousingisachieving.jpg" style="width: 100%" title="" /></div>

<p>Luxurious housing and <a href="https://www.hcorealestates.com/post/gated-communities-in-india/" target="_blank"><strong>gated communities in India</strong></a> have become a very important part of a country that is experiencing an impeccable demand for housing. Local as well as foreign investors are showing a great deal of interest in the properties in Delhi. People are becoming more aware of international design and aesthetics, increasing demand. All the factors described above are responsible for robust growth.</p>

<p>Kudos to the builders who are providing the luxury segments with great diversity offering an abundance of features and specifications. The following are 3 prime reasons why luxury housing is becoming increasingly popular in India.</p>

<h3><strong>A. Problem of abundance </strong></h3>

<p>Indeed the Indian real estate market is flooded with countless properties being <strong>luxury apartments</strong> a popular segment. Developers and investors both the parties are more attracted to luxury filling the homes with elegant facilities like home automation, smart interiors, temperature control pools, concierge services, sporting facilities, and many more are added for the aspiring homeowners.</p>

<h3><strong>B. Index of Cost</strong></h3>

<p>Price has always been the largest front that can hold or move the property from owning. It is the one factor that completely forces the investor to change their decision. But pricing depends on numerous factors like location, amenities, brand, etc. The cost of luxury housing in Delhi remains a major factor even though the trend is gaining popularity.</p>

<h3><strong>C. A Matter of Class</strong></h3>

<p>Every one of us is striving to catch the attention of society by owning everything prominent in terms of standard of living. Having a luxurious residence doesn&#39;t just mean that you live in the lap of luxury, but also that you live in the lap of class. Customers&#39; expectations continue to grow incredibly well, so developers are striving to add the most world-class and international features possible.</p>

<p>India&#39;s rise in luxury living has been influenced by these three factors in various combinations. Consumers&#39; ability and willingness to demand luxury living standards is the defining factor for Indian luxury living standards. As a result, when supply meets demand, everyone benefits.</p>

<h2><strong>Luxury Housing NOW &amp; THEN - Always Important</strong></h2>

<div class="body_img"><img alt="" src="https://www.hcorealestates.com/img/blogs/acb160bf33_LuxuryhousingNOW&amp;THEN.jpg" style="width: 100%" title="" /></div>

<p>Real estate is an industry that has no boundaries for growth and it is something that will keep on increasing forever. It is the safest and most trustworthy investment present in the market today and it will always remain the safest. The importance of residential is hardly comparable to that of any other type of real estate. Covid-19 has completely changed the perspective of investment as people are looking for a capacious and open living being one reason behind the growing demand for luxury housing. A majority of the audience in this segment are high-end corporate executives, chief executives, and business family members.</p>

<h2><strong>Let us now know the reason behind the exceptional demand for luxury housing and why it will continue in the future as well</strong></h2>

<div class="body_img"><img alt="" src="https://www.hcorealestates.com/img/blogs/1278087f7a_Letusnowknowthereasonbehind.jpg" style="width: 100%" title="" /></div>

<ol>
	<li>You have to dream big in your life if you want to achieve big in life. This is one of the most common aspirations of the young population these days that believe in everything big every time. They do not even take a single step without planning and owning a luxury living is one of the biggest and commonest dreams with a lavish car, big-sized home, huge amount of money, and peaceful living. This aspiration is something that kept the motivation alive in the youth of dreaming and achieving big.</li>
	<li>A completely new perspective towards living is rising in the current population. Earlier joint family living was in trend but now we are more focused on nuclear living in the home where every individual has their own space of living. But Covid now somewhere dismissed the concept of nuclear families as it made us realize the importance of counting on supportive people and the continuation of the league of ensuring the safety of the loved ones.</li>
	<li>There is no doubt that luxury and premium housing communities come with more and better amenities and complete security. Here, it is all about convenience, comfort, and security. You can sleep a peaceful night with better security options around the community and this is one driving reason that will keep its demand increasing in the future as well.</li>
	<li>Demand from the top-level people is opening the doors for developers to present some more luxury apartments as all the top-level executives, business class people, NRIs are more focused on luxury living. Be it is from an investment point of view or the living purpose; luxury housing is getting phenomenal attraction.</li>
	<li>Well, the returns over-investment in real estate is eye candy for the investors. I don&rsquo;t think there is any need to explain how important returns over investment are and price escalation in properties is always lucrative. One of the biggest reasons behind the investment is the future earnings that will constantly rise with demand and supply.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone in India aspires to own a beautiful home, especially one in the capital region. As the ever-increasing demand for housing is getting stronger every day, consumers who are still delaying the decision of purchase would be wise to act now imagining the overall rise in housing demand in the future.</p>

<h2><strong>What makes luxury apartments in Delhi so popular?</strong></h2>

<div class="body_img"><img alt="" src="https://www.hcorealestates.com/img/blogs/271a6f5648_Whatmakesluxuryapartments.jpg" style="width: 100%" title="" /></div>

<p>The clear-sighted millennial who was earlier looking for the properties on rent have now shifted their focus towards acquisition. Also, they are looking forward to settling in Delhi and this is the reason why there is a surge in the demand for luxury properties resulting in 40% growth in revenue and the demand for homes priced over 4Cr.</p>

<h2><strong>Let&rsquo;s take a quick recap of the trends boosting the growth of luxury apartments in Delhi.</strong></h2>

<div class="body_img"><img alt="" src="https://www.hcorealestates.com/img/blogs/a20e29fa6e_Let’stakeaquickrecapofthetrends.jpg" style="width: 100%" title="" /></div>

<p><strong>1. </strong>Location: Well, as explained above location has always been and will always be the most important factor considered for the perfect investment. An important rise has been observed in the buyer&#39;s list that is seeking the elite neighborhood with picturesque surroundings garnering the market attention. In terms of location, Delhi has some of the most prestigious locations in the city such as Defence Colony, Janak Puri, Jor Bagh, Shanti Niketan, Vasant Vihar, Panchsheel Park, and many more. They are among the most successful neighborhoods of Delhi that witness a great deal of demand. Over here, the price of a square yard of property ranges between 6 and 12 lakh.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>Delhi is of course a prime location for the first home as numerous families are already settled here but it is also witnessing interest in second homes. Buyers are more interested in the space outside their permanent living options as they get a change in living and this is the reason why hill stations and the holiday destinations garner so much attraction, similarly people from the outer cities and countries look forward to settling in Delhi that is paving their ways for luxurious investment. With exceptional connectivity, seamless traveling comfort, inside-outside architecture, wide job opportunities, different attractions, etc. leading to the sharp uptick in Delhi real estate.</p>

<p><strong>3. </strong>Decreased circle rates of Delhi&rsquo;s residential, commercial and industrial properties by 20% that was announced last year has been extended till 30 June 2022. The prolific announcement by the Delhi government of decreasing the circle rates has helped increase the demand for property sales in Delhi even in a pandemic as well. Looking at the increased sales after reduced circle rates, this has been getting extended for every six months; let&rsquo;s see what will be the next move.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The properties in Delhi have been divided into categories from A to H where the &ldquo;A&rdquo; category counts in the <strong>posh areas in Delhi</strong> whereas the &ldquo;H&rdquo; category includes the least developed areas. After the scheme, the areas covered in the A category have seen a fall in price from Rs 7.74 lakh per square meter to Rs 6.19 lakh per square meter and the H category has seen a fall in price from Rs 23,280 to Rs 18,624 per square meter.</p>

<h2><strong>Well, do you know what exactly the Circle rate in Delhi is?</strong></h2>

<div class="body_img"><img alt="" src="https://www.hcorealestates.com/img/blogs/90b42b1981_Well,doyouknowwhatexactly.jpg" style="width: 100%" title="" /></div>

<p>Circle rate is the minimum price that you have to pay when buying land, flats, or apartments in the area. It varies from one area to another.</p>

<p><strong>Knowing some of the factors impacting circle rate in Delhi</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Delhi circle rates are higher when more facilities are available.</li>
	<li>In Delhi, the circle rate is higher the higher the market value.</li>
	<li>Posh area circle rates are always higher than others.</li>
	<li>Commercial properties circle rates are higher than residential.</li>
</ul>
